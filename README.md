A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to connect to browser DevTools for debugging web applications. Works with any MCP-compatible tool including Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Roo-Cline, and more!

## What is this?

Browser Connect MCP gives AI assistants the ability to:
- üöÄ Launch Chrome with debugging enabled automatically
- üîç Read console logs and errors from your web pages
- üåê Monitor network requests and API calls
- üìä Analyze performance issues
- üîí Scan for security vulnerabilities
- ü§ñ Provide intelligent debugging insights

All through natural conversation - no coding required!

## Quick Start

### 1. Install via npx (Recommended - No Installation Required!)

Add to your AI assistant's MCP configuration. Here are examples for popular tools:

**Claude Desktop** (macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`, Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-connect": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["browser-connect-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "LOG_LEVEL": "info"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Cursor/Cline/Other MCP Tools**: Check your tool's documentation for MCP server configuration location.

### 2. Restart Your AI Assistant

After saving the configuration, restart your AI assistant application to load the browser debugging capabilities.

### 3. Start Debugging!

Just talk to your AI assistant naturally:

```
You: "Help me debug my website at localhost:3000"

AI: I'll help you debug your website. Let me launch Chrome with debugging enabled 
and connect to it.

[AI launches Chrome and connects automatically]

Now I'm connected to your browser. I can see the console messages and network traffic. 
What specific issues are you experiencing?

You: "The page is loading slowly"

AI: Let me analyze the performance of your page...

[AI automatically runs performance analysis]

I found several performance issues:
1. Large uncompressed images (3.2MB total)
2. Render-blocking JavaScript in the header
3. Multiple API calls that could be batched

Would you like me to investigate any of these issues in detail?
```

## Compatible AI Assistants

This MCP server works with any tool that supports the Model Context Protocol:

- **Claude Desktop** - Anthropic's official desktop app
- **Claude Code** - Anthropic's CLI for developers
- **Cursor** - AI-powered code editor
- **Cline** - Command-line AI assistant
- **Roo-Cline** - Enhanced version of Cline
- **Any MCP-compatible IDE or platform**

## What Can You Ask Your AI Assistant?

### Debugging Requests

- **"Launch Chrome and help me debug my website"**
- **"Debug my app running on localhost:3000"** - Automatically launches and connects
- **"Open localhost:8080 in my default browser"** - Opens in your preferred browser
- **"Connect to my existing Chrome browser"**
- **"Show me any JavaScript errors"**
- **"Are there any failed API calls?"**
- **"Why is my page loading slowly?"**
- **"Check for security vulnerabilities"**
- **"Find memory leaks"**
- **"Debug CORS issues"**
- **"Export network traffic for analysis"**

### Performance Analysis

- **"Analyze the performance of this page"**
- **"Which requests are taking the longest?"**
- **"Find performance bottlenecks"**
- **"Show me the slowest API endpoints"**

### Error Investigation

- **"What errors are happening?"**
- **"Find all TypeErrors in the console"**
- **"Show me errors related to authentication"**
- **"Are these errors related to each other?"**

### Security Checks

- **"Run a security scan"**
- **"Check if any sensitive data is exposed"**
- **"Look for security vulnerabilities"**
- **"Are there any insecure requests?"**

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Debugging API Errors

```
You: "My app isn't working, can you help debug it?"

AI: I'll help you debug your app. Let me connect to your browser and see what's happening.

[Automatically launches/connects to Chrome]

I can see your application. Let me check for any errors...

I found several issues:
1. API calls to /api/user are returning 401 Unauthorized errors
2. There are CORS errors when trying to access the payment service
3. Several "undefined is not a function" errors in your React components

The 401 errors suggest an authentication issue. Would you like me to:
- Look at the request headers to check authentication tokens?
- Find when the authentication errors started?
- Check if there are any related console errors?
```

### Example 2: Performance Optimization

```
You: "Users are complaining the checkout page is slow"

AI: I'll analyze the checkout page performance. Let me connect to your browser and load the checkout page.

[Connects and monitors the page load]

Here's what I found analyzing your checkout page:

Performance Issues:
1. Initial page load: 4.3 seconds (should be under 3s)
2. Largest Contentful Paint: 3.8 seconds
3. Time to Interactive: 5.2 seconds

Main bottlenecks:
- Product images are not optimized (2.1MB total)
- Stripe SDK loads synchronously, blocking render
- 3 sequential API calls that could run in parallel

Recommendations:
1. Compress and lazy-load product images
2. Load Stripe SDK asynchronously
3. Parallelize the API calls

Would you like me to show you the specific network requests causing delays?
```

### Example 3: Security Audit

```
You: "Can you check my app for security issues?"

AI: I'll run a comprehensive security scan on your application.

[Automatically scans console logs and network traffic]

Security Scan Results:

‚ö†Ô∏è High Priority Issues:
1. API keys exposed in console logs (GitHub API key found)
2. User passwords visible in network requests (should use HTTPS)
3. Missing security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options)

üîç Medium Priority:
1. Cookies without 'Secure' flag
2. LocalStorage containing sensitive user data
3. Mixed content warnings (HTTP resources on HTTPS page)

‚úì Good Security Practices Found:
1. HTTPS enabled on main domain
2. Authentication tokens expire appropriately
3. Input validation on forms

Would you like me to explain how to fix any of these issues?
```

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-connect": {
      "command": "browser-connect-mcp",
      "env": {
        "LOG_LEVEL": "info"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/perception30/browser-connect-mcp.git
cd browser-connect-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

## Configuration Examples for Different Tools

### Claude Desktop / Claude Code
```json
// macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
// Windows: %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-connect": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["browser-connect-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor IDE
Check Cursor's MCP settings in the preferences/settings panel for adding MCP servers.

### Cline/Roo-Cline
These CLI tools typically use a configuration file like `.cline/config.json`. Consult their documentation for MCP server setup.

### VS Code MCP Extensions
Configuration varies by extension. Look for MCP server settings in the extension's configuration panel.

## Troubleshooting

### "My AI assistant can't connect to my browser"
- Make sure you've restarted your AI assistant application after updating the configuration
- Try asking "Launch a new Chrome browser for debugging"
- Check that Chrome/Chromium is installed on your system

### "No data is appearing"
- Ensure the web page is loaded and active
- Try refreshing the page after your AI assistant connects
- Ask your AI to "Check the connection status"

### "Chrome won't launch"
- The MCP server will try to find Chrome automatically
- If it fails, make sure Chrome or Chromium is installed
- On Linux, you might need to install `chromium-browser`

## How It Works

When you ask your AI assistant to debug your website, this MCP server:

1. **Launches or connects to Chrome** with debugging protocol enabled
2. **Establishes a debugging session** using Chrome DevTools Protocol
3. **Monitors console and network events** in real-time
4. **Provides your AI assistant with debugging data** to analyze and help you
5. **Maintains context** throughout your debugging conversation

All of this happens automatically - you just describe what you need!

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Only**: All debugging happens on your local machine
- **No Data Storage**: Information is only kept during the active session
- **Secure by Default**: Uses Chrome DevTools Protocol securely
- **Permission-Based**: AI assistants ask before performing actions
