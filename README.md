## Quick Start

### 1. Install via npx (Recommended - No Installation Required!)

Add to your AI assistant's MCP configuration. Here are examples for popular tools:

**IMPORTANT:** Due to how MCP clients handle spawning commands, you MUST use the following configuration format with `npx` as the command and the package name as an argument:

**Claude Desktop** (macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`, Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-connect": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "browser-connect-mcp@0.4.1"],
      "env": {
        "LOG_LEVEL": "info"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** The `-y` flag ensures npx runs without prompting, and the version ensures you're using the latest stable release.

**Cursor/Cline/Other MCP Tools**: Check your tool's documentation for MCP server configuration location.

### 2. Restart Your AI Assistant

After saving the configuration, restart your AI assistant application to load the browser debugging capabilities.

### 3. Start Debugging!

Just talk to your AI assistant naturally:

```
You: "Help me debug my website at localhost:3000"

AI: I'll help you debug your website. Let me launch Chrome with debugging enabled 
and connect to it.

[AI launches Chrome and connects automatically]

Now I'm connected to your browser. I can see the console messages and network traffic. 
What specific issues are you experiencing?

You: "The page is loading slowly"

AI: Let me analyze the performance of your page...

[AI automatically runs performance analysis]

I found several performance issues:
1. Large uncompressed images (3.2MB total)
2. Render-blocking JavaScript in the header
3. Multiple API calls that could be batched

Would you like me to investigate any of these issues in detail?
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Debugging API Errors

```
You: "My app isn't working, can you help debug it?"

AI: I'll help you debug your app. Let me connect to your browser and see what's happening.

[Automatically launches/connects to Chrome]

I can see your application. Let me check for any errors...

I found several issues:
1. API calls to /api/user are returning 401 Unauthorized errors
2. There are CORS errors when trying to access the payment service
3. Several "undefined is not a function" errors in your React components

The 401 errors suggest an authentication issue. Would you like me to:
- Look at the request headers to check authentication tokens?
- Find when the authentication errors started?
- Check if there are any related console errors?
```

### Example 2: Performance Optimization

```
You: "Users are complaining the checkout page is slow"

AI: I'll analyze the checkout page performance. Let me connect to your browser and load the checkout page.

[Connects and monitors the page load]

Here's what I found analyzing your checkout page:

Performance Issues:
1. Initial page load: 4.3 seconds (should be under 3s)
2. Largest Contentful Paint: 3.8 seconds
3. Time to Interactive: 5.2 seconds

Main bottlenecks:
- Product images are not optimized (2.1MB total)
- Stripe SDK loads synchronously, blocking render
- 3 sequential API calls that could run in parallel

Recommendations:
1. Compress and lazy-load product images
2. Load Stripe SDK asynchronously
3. Parallelize the API calls

Would you like me to show you the specific network requests causing delays?
```

### Example 3: Security Audit

```
You: "Can you check my app for security issues?"

AI: I'll run a comprehensive security scan on your application.

[Automatically scans console logs and network traffic]

Security Scan Results:

‚ö†Ô∏è High Priority Issues:
1. API keys exposed in console logs (GitHub API key found)
2. User passwords visible in network requests (should use HTTPS)
3. Missing security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options)

üîç Medium Priority:
1. Cookies without 'Secure' flag
2. LocalStorage containing sensitive user data
3. Mixed content warnings (HTTP resources on HTTPS page)

‚úì Good Security Practices Found:
1. HTTPS enabled on main domain
2. Authentication tokens expire appropriately
3. Input validation on forms

Would you like me to explain how to fix any of these issues?
```

### Example 4: Full-Stack Debugging (NEW!)

```
You: "My users are getting 500 errors but I can't figure out why"

AI: I'll help you debug this issue by examining both frontend and backend. Let me start by connecting to your browser and checking for errors.

[Connects to browser and analyzes network traffic]

I see multiple 500 errors from /api/checkout. Now let me check your backend logs to understand what's happening server-side.

[Streams backend logs]

Found the issue! Here's what's happening:

Frontend (Browser):
- POST /api/checkout returning 500 errors
- Errors started 15 minutes ago
- Affecting 23% of requests

Backend (Server Logs):
- Database connection pool exhausted
- "Error: Connection timeout" in checkout handler
- Memory usage spiking before errors

Root Cause:
Your checkout process isn't closing database connections properly, leading to connection pool exhaustion under load.

Quick Fix:
Add connection.release() after your database queries in the checkout handler.

Long-term Fix:
Implement connection pooling with automatic cleanup and monitoring.
```

```

Then update your AI assistant's config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-connect": {
      "command": "browser-connect-mcp",
      "env": {
        "LOG_LEVEL": "info"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/perception30/browser-connect-mcp.git
cd browser-connect-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

## Configuration Examples for Different Tools

### Claude Desktop / Claude Code
```json
// macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
// Windows: %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-connect": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "browser-connect-mcp@0.4.1"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** Always use `npx` as the command with the package name (including version) as arguments. Do NOT use the package name directly as the command - this will cause a "spawn ENOENT" error.

### Cursor IDE
Check Cursor's MCP settings in the preferences/settings panel for adding MCP servers.

### Cline/Roo-Cline
These CLI tools typically use a configuration file like `.cline/config.json`. Consult their documentation for MCP server setup.

### VS Code MCP Extensions
Configuration varies by extension. Look for MCP server settings in the extension's configuration panel.

## Troubleshooting

### "My AI assistant can't connect to my browser"
- Make sure you've restarted your AI assistant application after updating the configuration
- Try asking "Launch a new Chrome browser for debugging"
- Check that Chrome/Chromium is installed on your system

### "No data is appearing"
- Ensure the web page is loaded and active
- Try refreshing the page after your AI assistant connects
- Ask your AI to "Check the connection status"

### "Chrome won't launch"
- The MCP server will try to find Chrome automatically
- If it fails, make sure Chrome or Chromium is installed
- On Linux, you might need to install `chromium-browser`

### "Backend debugging not working"
- For Node.js debugging, ensure your app is started with `--inspect` flag
- Check that log files have read permissions
- For Docker logs, ensure Docker is running and you have permissions
- Verify the debug port (default 9229) is not blocked by firewall

## How It Works
