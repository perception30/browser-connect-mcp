### Documentation Updates

1. **NPM_DOCUMENTATION.md**

   - Changed "Claude Desktop app" to "MCP-compatible AI assistant"
   - Updated all example dialogs from "Human/Claude" to "User/AI"
   - Made configuration instructions more generic with examples for different tools

2. **QUICK_REFERENCE.md**
   - Updated configuration instructions to be tool-agnostic
   - Changed "Claude Desktop" references to "your AI assistant"
   - Made language more inclusive of all MCP tools

3. **API_USAGE_EXAMPLES.md**
   - Updated best practices to reference "your AI" instead of "Claude"
   - Maintained technical accuracy while being tool-agnostic

### Key Improvements

1. **Inclusivity**: Documentation now clearly states this works with ANY MCP-compatible tool
2. **Examples**: Provided configuration examples for multiple popular tools
3. **Flexibility**: Users of any MCP tool can now understand how to use this server
4. **Future-proof**: References to "any MCP-compatible tool" ensure new tools are implicitly supported

The documentation now accurately reflects that Browser Connect MCP is a universal tool for any AI assistant supporting the Model Context Protocol, not just Claude.
